# Smart Insole Project

## 📌 Overview

The **Smart Insole Project** aims to develop an intelligent wearable insole capable of monitoring foot pressure and motion in real-time. This system helps in classifying physical activities, analyzing gait, and potentially preventing injuries through data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks pressure across different zones of the foot (heel, midfoot, forefoot).
- **Activity Recognition**: Uses sensor data and machine learning to classify different activities (walking,jumping, tapping, etc.).
- **Data Collection**: Gathers data via pressure sensors and IMU for training and testing.
- **Expandable**: Designed to integrate with additional hardware or cloud platforms for extended functionality.
