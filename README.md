# Smart Insole Project

## üìå Overview

This project focuses on developing a smart insole that is able to recognize eight different physical activities using integrated textile-based sensors. The system is designed to detect foot movements due to varying pressure on the insole. By integrating textile-based sensors, the system collects real-time data and processes it by using machine learning algorithms to classify the different activities. The project emphasizes wearability, cost-efficiency and sustainability while maintaining high recognition accuracy. 

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks pressure across different zones of the foot (heel, midfoot, forefoot).
- **Activity Recognition**: Uses sensor data and machine learning to classify different activities (walking,jumping, tapping, etc.).
- **Data Collection**: Gathers data via pressure sensors and IMU for training and testing.
- **Expandable**: Designed to integrate with additional hardware or cloud platforms for extended functionality.





## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
